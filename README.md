## Developer Applicant Interview Test
Summary

The current project is part of a technical review with a time limit of 5 days to develop it.
A weather application is required where you must use some weather service, and some service to identify the location by ip.
The application should allow the user to choose between five cities (including their current position) and see the current temperature and the five-day forecast.
You should develop it with react and TS, no design will be evaluated.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
**IMPORTANT: You must replace your api-key into src/services/weather-services.ts {YOUR API KEY}
or use the mocks services into src/store/reducers/app-state/app-service-actions**
